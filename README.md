# ✨ UI Engineer Internship Project — BuiltWithAngga (BWA)

Welcome to my project repository for **BuiltWithAngga's UI Engineer Internship**! 🎉 This project is part of my journey as a UI Engineer intern, where I was tasked with slicing and coding a beautiful design from **ShaynaKit** using the magic of **Tailwind CSS** ✨.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of one of the stunning designs from **[ShaynaKit](https://shaynakit.com)**, a platform known for its sleek and modern UI designs. My goal here was to bring the design to life using **Tailwind CSS**—keeping the code clean, modular, and scalable, while maintaining pixel-perfect accuracy.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate my skills in:
- **Attention to detail** when converting designs to code 🎨
- Following best practices in **UI engineering** 💻

This project also fulfills one of the core requirements of my internship program at **[BuiltWithAngga (BWA)](https://buildwithangga.com)**, where I have the honor of honing my front-end development skills.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS** — the framework that makes styling a breeze 🌬️
- **HTML5** — the foundation of the web 🌐
- **ShaynaKit Design** — a modern, clean, and elegant UI template 🎨
